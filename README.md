### Hi there 👋

I’m **Fausto Genga**, an Informatics Engineering graduate with a passion for turning data into insight and ideas into impact. During my internship at Procter & Gamble, I developed dynamic Power BI solutions that supported smarter, data-driven decisions.

I bring not only technical skills but also strong communication, adaptability, and a collaborative mindset. With a multicultural background and a drive for continuous learning, I’m excited to contribute to innovative, team-oriented environments.
